Digital Rebar 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*simple, fast and open-ecosystem infrastructure automation with strong Infrastructure as Code (IaC) design.*

`Digital Rebar (aka DRP) <http://rebar.digital>`_ is a `RackN <https://rackn.com>`_ licensed-core platform with an open ecosystem suite of both licensed and open `APLv2 <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalrebar/provision/v4/LICENSE>`_ components.  The fourth generation platform provides a simple yet complete API-driven DHCP/PXE/TFTP provisioning and workflow system.

Digital Rebar Platform and Ecosystem are designed together to be a complete data center provisioning, content scaffolding and infrastructure workflow platform with a cloud native architecture that completely replaces Cobbler, Foreman, MaaS, Ironic or similar technologies. DRP offers a single golang binary (less than 30MB) with no dependencies capable of installation on a laptop, RPi or switch supporting both bare metal and virtualized infrastructure.

Key Features:

  Platform Capabilities:
    * API-driven infrastructure-as-code automation
    * Multi-boot workflows using composable and reusable building blocks
    * Event driven actions via Websockets API
    * Extensible Plug-in Model for public, vendor and internal enhancements
    * Dynamic Workflow Contexts (allows using APIs when agents cannot be run)
    * Distributed Multi-Site Management
    * Integrated Secure Boot, SSO and Highly Available options.
    * Supports ALL orchestration tools including Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack, Bosh, Terraform, etc

  Open Ecosystem Plugins:
    * RAID, IPMI, Redfish, and BIOS Configuration
    * Cloud-like pooling capabilities
    * Classification engine for automated workflow

Install & Quick Start
---------------------

.. note::  We HIGHLY recommend using the ``latest`` version of the documentation, as it contains the most up to date information.  Use the version selector in the lower right corner of your browser.

Our `Quick Start <http://provision.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/quickstart.html>`_ has fast play-with-it steps.  Don't worry, they are very simple and take 10 to 20 minutes.  You can choose from stable or tip.  Tip is the very bleeding edge of development.

Regular `Install <http://provision.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/install.html>`_ for more details on the install steps.  These include production options. (`Previous Version Docs <http://provision.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/quickstart.html>`_)

Current Stable Line is the :ref:`rs_release_v45` and next Release is planned to be :ref:`rs_release_v46`.  See :ref:`rs_release_summaries` for a complete list.

Components & Extensions
-----------------------

Digital Rebar Provision is composable by design.  Much of our advanced funtionality is exposed in :ref:`rs_content_packages` that are added into the system as content and plugins which have documentation embedded in the extension.
