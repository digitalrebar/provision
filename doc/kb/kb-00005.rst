Generate Certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Description
-----------

The generated self signed certificate doesn't appear to be working.  Is it possible to
generate a new certificate for the system?


Solution
--------

Sometimes the cert/key pair in the github tree is corrupt or not sufficient for the environment.  The following command can be used to rebuild a local cert/key pair.

  ::

    sudo openssl req -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -nodes

It may be necessary to install the openssl tools.
