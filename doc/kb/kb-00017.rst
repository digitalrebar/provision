Custom Kickstart and Preseeds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Description
-----------

Most Digital Rebar community content Boot Environments (*BootEnvs*) utilize a templatized
kickstart or preeseed file.  In many cases, an operator may need to provide extensive
customizations to these templates to meet their operational needs.  These templates can
be replace "on-the-fly" with in-field custom templates.

.. note:: It is **strongly** encourage that you replicate the two *post* lines that reset
          workflow, and enable installer based DRP Agent/Runner services, to provide
          customization and/or notification of completion to the DRP Endpoint.  Failure to
          do so (or manually arrange advancing the Workflow tasks states), will result
          in a system install that appears to "hang", or may restart loop and repeat the
          installation indefinitely.

Solution
--------

You can now define a custom Kickstart or Preseed (aka *kickseed*) to override the defaults in the selected
*BootEnv*.  You simply need to only define a single Param (``select-kickseed``) with the name of the
Kickstart or Preseed you wish to override the default value.

  ::

    # obtain the Machine UUID, or replace $UUID with 'Name:<machine_name>'
    export UUID="f6ca7bb6-d74f-4bc1-8544-f3df500fb15e"
    drpcli machines set $UUID param select-kickseed to "my_kickstart.cfg"

Of course, you can apply a Param to a Profile, and apply that Profile to a group of Machines if desired.

.. warning:: The Digital Rebar default kickstart and preseeds have Digital Rebar specific interactions
             that may be necessary to replicate.  Please review the default kickstart and preseeds for
             patterns and examples you may need to re-use.   We HIGHLY recommend you start with a
             `clone` operation of an existing Kickstart/Preseed file; and making appropriate
             modifications from that as a baseline.
