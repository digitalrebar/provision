kb-00034: Network Unreachable from Wget / Second Stage Timeout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Description
-----------

This article addresses problems with second stage and wget problems during the PXE
bootstrapping process of an operating system.  Generally speaking, these issues are
related to the Top-of-Rack switch configuration, causing port blocking delays.


Solution
--------

Throwing a *network unreachable* error from ``wget`` when trying to fetch second stage ``initramfs``; however, by the
time you get dropped into a root console, eth0 has an IP address and can connect to the server fine.  May also
see a baremetal PXE boot initial PXE boot works but then it's getting kicked to a shell before it can download
``root.squashfs``.

Troubleshooting: You can manually grab the file with ``wget`` after it bails, so communications are working fine.
It just appears it's not waiting long enough for DHCP and then fails to get the file before it gets an IP.

.. note:: You can set these changes the global profile so it will apply everywhere.  It shouldn’t hurt
          functioning systems (they will escape the loop early) and might fix this system.


**Solution 1**: Do you run your switches with Portfast? or Spanning Tree delays?

You add these to your kernel-console parameter to alter the retry and wait times.
  * ``provisioner.portdelay=<Number of seconds>`` - seconds to wait before bring up link
  * ``provisioner.postportdelay=<Number of seconds>`` - seconds to wait after bringing up link before dhcp
  * ``provisioner.wgetretrycount=<Number of retries before failure>`` - wget of squashfs occurs once a second for 10 times by default.


**Solution 2**: Is something is really "slower" than sledgehammer expects?

You could try setting ``provisioner.wgetretrycount=60``.  ``kernel-console`` is a parameter that lets you
changing the kernel parameters passed to bootenvs.  Sometimes it is used to tweak the kernel console that
the kernel is using, but it can be used for other values as well.
