kb-00003: Bind Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Description
-----------

The Digital Rebar Provision service (``dr-provision``) failed to start up.  I received an
error about *address already in use*.


Solution
--------

Digital Rebar Provision will fail if it cannot attach to one of the required ports.

* Typical Error Message: "listen udp4 :67: bind: address already in use"
* Additional Information: The conflicted port will be included in the error between colons (e.g.: `:67:`)
* Workaround: If the conflicting service is not required, simply disable that service
* Resolution: Stop the offending service on the system.  Typical corrective actions are:

  * 67 - dhcp.  Correct with `sudo pkill dnsmasq`

See the port mapping list on start-up of the ``dr-provision`` service for a complete list.

Once ``dr-provision`` is running, you can obtain a list of the ports that it's holding open
with the following CLI command:

* ``drpcli info status``
