Rebooting without IPMI plugins (without a Task)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Description
-----------

There are many ways to handle Machine reboots.  This article describes some alternate ways
that a Machine reboot may be induced in to a running system, without use of an external Baseboard
Management Controller (BMC) via the IPMI or Redfish protocols.

.. note:: Running tasks in Workflow can cause reboot conditions based on the scripts exit
          codes.


Solution
--------

The Runner will automatically reboot the system if the BootEnv changes during a Workflow.  You can
force this behavior by changing the BootEnv to `local` on the machine manually then starting a
Workflow with a different BootEnv like `discover`.  This will cause the runner to reboot the machine.

Steps:
  #. Clear the Machine Workflow
  #. Set the Machine BootEnv to `local`
  #. Update
  #. Set the Workflow to a workflow with a different BootEnv.
  #. Update and watch machine reboot
