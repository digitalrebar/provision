kb-00055: Troubleshooting Runner does not connect

Description
-----------

I have booted a machine (or used the join-up script) but the machine is not showing runnable (aka Ready) or being created during discover?

I realize that means that the agent/runner is not starting correctly, but how can I figure out what's going on?

Solution
--------

There are number of reasons why the DRP runner is not able to start on a system.  This article will help identify where to look for logs.  Generally, details in the logs are sufficient to identify the failure to start or connect reason.

Note: depending on your start-up, there are differences between discovery and join-up processes so some suggestions here may not apply.

Note: these instructions assume that you can log into the machine(s) in question.

Did Discovery Start control.sh?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Sledgehammer and netboot installation, Digital Rebar injects values into the bootstrap process.

Use ``cat /proc/cmdline`` to ensure that the ``BOOTIF`` and ``provisioner.web`` values are being set.

Note: join-up systems will not have specialized settings.

Is the runner starting then failing?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the runner is starting and then failing, then the runner logs will provide helpful information.  Either review configuration at ``/var/lib/drp-agent`` or try ``journalctl -u sledgehammer``

Did discovery-common-bootstrap.sh get created?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the first things creating during runner bootstrap is the ``/tmp/discovery-common-bootstrap.sh`` file.  Check to see if that file exists.

If it is missing, then the basic discovery process failed.


Did Jobs start running?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases, the runner starts but then fails.  This may indiciate a configuration or resource problem on the machine.

If the runner was able to start, then jobs lobs will be created under ``/tmp/runner-*`` on the system.

Can DRPCLI connect?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the first things that the runner will check is access to the system.  Test access to the DRP server by using ``drpcli -E [https://endpoint IP] -P [password] machines whoami``.

Success with whoami confirms connectivity to the DRP server and also shows how the server identifies the machine in question.grep

Is control.sh avialable?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During discovery or join-up of _known_ machines machines will download the ``control.sh`` bootstrap script from the DRP Server from http://[drp ip]:8091/machines/[machine uuid]/control.sh.  If this file is not avialable at this URL then the process will fail.

This will happen if the machine is using ``local`` or ``ignore`` bootenvs.  It can also happen if the DRP Unknown Workflow/Stage/BootEnv values are not set.

Did control.sh or join-up.sh start?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When attaching discovered or netbooted machines, the system uses ``control.sh`` to connect.

When attaching to existing machines, such as cloud joins, the system uses ``join-up.sh`` to connect.

In many cases, the machine's UUID is already presentnon the system as ``/etc/rs-uuid``.  Check to see if this file exists and contains the correct UUID.

Test the ``/tmp/control.sh`` or ``join-up.sh`` script by simply running it on the system and watching the results.

What about DRP Server logs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While runner connect issues are generally machine related.  DRP Server logs (or lack of them) can be a helpful diagnostic tool.

Use ``journalctl -u dr-provision`` to observe the logs.
