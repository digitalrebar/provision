kb-00036: No matching Subnet (MacOS DHCP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _rs_no_matching_subnet:

Knowledge Base Article: kb-00036
--------------------------------


Description
-----------

DHCP will not respond when running DRP from a Mac.  Log provides "No Matching Subnet" warning.


Solution
--------

This is likely caused by not configuring the *MAC DARWIN*" route correctly as per :ref:`rs_quickstart`.

Make sure that the address on the MAC should be outside the range.  Then set the ip, add the route, and
then (re)start DRP.  Make sure all the broadcast routes are deleted first using ``sudo route delete 255.255.255.255`` multiple times.
