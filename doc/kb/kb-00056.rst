kb-00056: Troubleshooting Portal WebSockets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _rs_kb_00056:

Knowledge Base Article: kb-00056
--------------------------------


Description
-----------

Occasionally the RackN Portal will have connectivity issues due to the self-signed certificates expiring.

When the socket loses connection, a megaphone icon button on the top left will flash red and say "Unable to access DRP"

Clicking this icon will yield the error code and status.


Solution
--------

See additional information for a list of error codes.

The most common and hard to troubleshoot issue is the `1006 - CLOSE_ABNORMAL` error. This usually happens when the browser does not show the accept certificate page when the websocket is getting TLS errors.

The easiest fix is to completely close and re-open the browser so the accept certificate dialog can be shown.


Additional Information
----------------------

List of RFC6455 Web Socket status codes, most of which are never seen or are not used:

  * ``1000`` - ``CLOSE_NORMAL`` - Normal closure
  * ``1001`` - ``CLOSE_GOING_AWAY`` - Server goes down or webpage is navigated away from
  * ``1002`` - ``CLOSE_PROTOCOL_ERROR`` - Endpoint terminates connection due to protocol error
  * ``1003`` - ``CLOSE_UNSUPPORTED`` - DRP or UX sends unsupported data (binary instead of text)
  * ``1005`` - ``CLOSED_NO_STATUS`` - Should never get this, it means no status code was provided
  * ``1006`` - ``CLOSE_ABNORMAL`` - Socket closed without a close control frame - likely due to TLS errors
  * ``1007`` - ``Unsupported payload`` - Sending non-UTC-8 data
  * ``1008`` - ``Policy violation`` - Should never get this, it means the message violates policy
  * ``1009`` - ``CLOSE_TOO_LARGE`` - Happens when a message is too long, the portal should automatically reconnect
  * ``1010`` - ``Mandatory extension`` - Not implemented
  * ``1011`` - ``Server error`` - Server crashed
  * ``1012`` - ``Service restart`` - Server is restarting
  * ``1013`` - ``Try again later`` - Not implemented
  * ``1014`` - ``Bad gateway`` - Not implemented
  * ``1015`` - ``TLS handshake fail`` - Server certificate cannot be verified
