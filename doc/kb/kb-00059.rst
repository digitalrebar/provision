kb-00059: Use Let's Encrypt Certificates with DRP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _rs_kb_00059:

Knowledge Base Article: kb-00059
--------------------------------


Description
-----------

This knowledge base describes one example of using Let's Encrypt TLS Certificates
for the ``dr-provision`` service (DRP Endpoint).  This is only one example of how
you might use Let'S Encrypt.


Solution
--------

This solution uses the ``certbot`` tool to interact with the Let's Encrypt APIs
to authenticate and get a TLS Certificate.  Other tools exist that will handle
this capability for you.

**This solution assumes you are running the commands at the Shell of the DRP Endpoint.**

All Let's Encrypt prerequisites/requirements must be in place prior to running
this process.  For example, valid DNS records MUST be setup in advance, for the
Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the DRP Endpoint server.

1.  `Install Certbot <https://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-manage-lets-encrypt-ssl-tls-certificates-with-certbot/#installing-certbot>`_
2.  Run ``certbot`` in standalone mode

  ::

    certbot certonly --standalone

3.  Follow the prompts from the CLI tool.  This generates certificates in:

    * ``/etc/letsencrypt/live/[drp fqdn]/`` - replace "*[drp fqdn]*" with your FQDN (e.g. drp.example.com)

4.  Configure **SystemD** to now use the new certificate and private key:

  ::

    DRP_ENDPOINT="drp.example.com"  # SET THIS APPROPRIATELY !!

    cat <<EOF > /etc/systemd/system/dr-provision.service.d/certificate.conf
    [Service]
    Environment=RS_TLS_KEY_FILE=/etc/letsencrypt/live/$DRP_ENDPOINT/privkey.pem
    Environment=RS_TLS_CERT_FILE=/etc/letsencrypt/live/$DRP_ENDPOINT/fullchain.pem
    EOF

5.  Notify SystemD of updated config files, and restart DRP Endpoint

  ::

    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemclt restart dr-provision

6. Verify/test the TLS certificate is as expected (using ``openssl``)

  ::

    DRP_ENDPOINT="drp.example.com"  # SET THIS APPROPRIATELY !!

    openssl s_client -showcerts -connect $DRP_ENDPOINT:8092


In the final verification step, it should be clearly identified that the TLS Certificate
is issued by Let's Encrypt.


Additional Information
----------------------

This document only focuses on initial setup of getting a Let's Encrypt certificate.
It does not discuss ongoing certificate renewal and management issues.

The example used in this document shows how to configure SystemD to utilize the
certificate.  The generated certificates can be used in other modes of operation.
See the ``dr-provision`` binary help (eg ``dr-provision --help``) for more details
on the options around certificates and keys.
