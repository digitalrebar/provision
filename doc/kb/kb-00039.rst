kb-00039: RBAC - Limit Users to Just Poweron and Poweroff IPMI Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Description
-----------

This article describes how to create a limited *role* with *claims* (rights) to only poweron and poweroff
Machines.  This example can be used as the foundating to understand how to add additional Roles with
different Claims capabilities.


Solution
--------

The Role Base Access and Controls subsystem allows an operator to construct user account permissions to limit
the scope that a user can impact the Digital Rebar Provision system.  Below is an example of how to create
a *Claim* that assigns the ``Role`` named ``prod-role`` that limits to only allow IPMI ``poweron`` and
``poweroff`` actions.  These permissions are applied to the _specific_ set of _scope_ *Machines*:

  ::

    drpcli roles update prod-role '"Claims": [{"action": "action:poweron, action:poweroff", "scope": "machines", "specific": "*"}]'

Now simply assign this Role to the given users you wish to limit their permissions on.
