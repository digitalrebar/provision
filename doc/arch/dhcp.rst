DHCP Models
^^^^^^^^^^^

These models manage how the DHCP server built into dr-provision.  They
determines what IP addresses it can hand out to which systems, what
values to set for DHCP options, and how to handle DHCP requests at
various points in the lifecycle of any given DHCP lease.

Interface
---------

Interface objects are provided by dr-provision as an easy means for
the UX and the CLI to enumerate the network interfaces on the
dr-provision server and provide some basic information for building
local subnets.  Interface objects have the following fields:

- Name: the name of the interface that the OS assigned.

- Index: The index of the interface.  This is an OS specific index,
  and does not mean anything to dr-provision directly.

- Addresses: A list of CIDR addresses that are bound to the interface.

- ActiveAddress: The CIDR address that you should use as the Subnet
  address if you want to create a Subnet specifically for this
  interface.

.. _rs_dhcp_option:

DHCP Option
-----------

The DHCP Option object holds templated values for DHCP options that
should be returned to clients in response to requests.  It has the
following fields:

- Code: A byte that holds the numeric DHCP option code. See `RFC 2132
  <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2132>`_ and friends for what these
  codes can be.

- Value: A string that will be template-expanded to form a valid value
  to return as the DHCP option.  Template expansion happens in the
  context of the source options.

.. _rs_dhcp_subnet:

Subnet
------

The Subnet Object defines the configuration of a single subnet for the
DHCP server to process.  Multiple subnets are allowed.  The Subnet can
represent a local subnet attached to a local interface (Broadcast
Subnet) to the Digital Rebar Provision server or a subnet that is
being forwarded or relayed (Relayed Subnet) to the Digital Rebar
Provision server.  Subnet objects have the following fields:

- Name: The unique name of this Subnet.

- Enabled: A boolean value that indicates whether this subnet is
  available to hand out new Leases, and whether to allow renewals of
  any Leases in its range.  Setting this to `true` allows the subnet
  to operate normally, and setting it to `false` will cause
  dr-provision to refuse to hand out new Leases for addresses in its
  range and will cause lease renewals for already existing Leases in
  its address range to fail.

- Strategy: A string that determines how the subnet will uniquely
  identify part of the DHCP request for address assignment.

- Proxy: A boolean value that indicates that dr-provision should
  respond to requests for addresses in this address range as if it was
  a proxy DHCP server (as defined in section 2 of `the PXE
  specification
  <http://www.pix.net/software/pxeboot/archive/pxespec.pdf>`_).

- Unmanaged: A boolean value that indicates whether dr-provision will
  send any DHCP options required for a system to boot over the
  network.  If this bit is set, dr-provision will never send any DHCP
  options that may be needed to network boot a system.

- Subnet: The network address in CIDR form of this Subnet.  Subnets
  may not have overlapping address ranges.

- ActiveStart: This is the start of the IP address range that this
  subnet will hand out.  It must be within the address range the
  Subnet is responsible for, and it must be less than ActiveEnd.

- ActiveEnd: This is the end of the IP address range that this subnet
  will hand out.  It must be within the address range the Subnet is
  responsible for, and it must be greater than ActiveStart.

- ActiveLeaseTime: This is the time (in seconds) that a lease created
  in this subnet will be valid for.

- ReservedLeaseTime: This is the time (in seconds) that a lease
  created by a Reservation in this subnet will be valid for.  It
  overrides ActiveLeaseTime.

- OnlyReservations: If set to `true`, then Leases in this subnet range
  can only be created if there is a reservation created for the
  requested address.

- Options: A list of DhcpOption objects that should be returned in any
  replies to dhcp requests.

.. _rs_dhcp_reservation:

Reservation
-----------

Reservations are what the dr-provision DHCP service uses to ensure
that an IP address is always issued to the same device.  Reservations
have the following fields:

- Strategy: The strategy that the DHCP service should use to determine
  whether this reservations should be used.

- Token: The string that the Strategy uniquely identifies a
  network interface with.

- Address: The IP address that is being reserved.

- Options: The DHCP options that should be returned when creating or
  renewing a Lease based on this Reservation.

.. note:: If you create a static reservation DRP will always respond to the request even if the subnet is "disabled"


.. _rs_dhcp_lease:

Lease
-----

Leases track what IP addresses the system has handed out to what
Strategy/Token pairs.  Leases contain the following fields:

- Strategy: The strategy that the DHCP service used to allocate the IP
  address this lease handed out.

- Token: The string that the Strategy uniquely identifies a
  network interface with.

- Address: The IP address that was handed out.

- State: The state the lease is in.  State can be one of the follosing
  values:

  - PROBE: The IP address is being probed via ICMP Echo Requests to
    make sure it is not in use by another system.

  - OFFER: The IP address was offered to a system in response to
    a DHCP discover.

  - ACK: The IP address was offered in response to a DHCP Request.

- ExpireTime: The time at which the Lease expires.
