Developing Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an open source project, we encourage community feedback and involvement.  Docs can be updated by 
pull requests against the `github <https://github.com/digitalrebar/provision>`_ repository either from a private
tree or directly against the tree.

A couple of notes about consistency.

#. Digital Rebar is the name of the parent project and can be abbreviated DR.
#. Digital Rebar Provision or DR Provision or DRP can be used to reference this part of the project.
#. API docs generated from the go files as part of swagger annotations of the godoc comments.  Update there, please.
#. CLI docs generated from the cli files as part of cobra structures.  The tools generate those.  Update there, please.

Otherwise, try and find a good place for what needs to be added.  And Thanks!
