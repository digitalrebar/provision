Developer Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This page is intended for people who are building Digital Rebar Provision from sources or contributing to the code base.  We maintain inline documentation and test environment and contributors are expected to participate in maintenance of those efforts.

.. note:: Prerequisites: go version 1.8 or better.  These documents expect ability to both install and update Golang.

.. _re_dev_quick:

Developer Quick Start
---------------------

To get started quickly, all the installation steps are rolled into a script.  The script can be run directly from Github by copying the following lines:

  ::

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalrebar/provision/v4/tools/build.sh | bash

The script will use the current **GOPATH** variable for placing the code.  If **GOPATH** isn't set,
it will be set to *$HOME/go*.

Once the script is complete, it is possible to change the directory to the source area and continue development.

  ::

    export GOPATH=${GOPATH:-$HOME/go}
    cd "$GOPATH/src/github.com/digitalrebar/provision"


If more details on how to run the result are needed, consult the :ref:`rs_install` section.  The **install.sh** script
can be used to install from the source directory after a build.

.. _rs_dev_build:

Building The API
----------------

After the code and assets have been obtained once, the process can be repeated from the project root with the following command:

  ::

    tools/build.sh


Another reason to use the *tools/build.sh* script is that it will inject version information into the built binaries to make
it easier to track what version is deployed.  Developer builds and production builds will be identifiable through the *version*
command on both the server and the cli.

.. note:: If you have performed a previous build and generated assets are updated, you may need to delete `embedded` directory and checkout `git checkout --embedded` then rebuild to ensure that the server can start.  This problem manifests with the error: `No such embedded asset chain.c32: Asset chain.c32 not found`


.. _rs_testing:

Running the Tests
-----------------

Digital Rebar Provision uses the Golang test libraries and the development team works hard to maintain test coverage.

The ``tools/test.sh`` in the provision root directory is the main way to test the entire code base.

To test individual modules from their subdirectories run: ``go test``

How to get Swagger-Ui
---------------------

DigiatlRebar Provision uses Swagger to generate interactive help for the API.  This is in the tree by default.  If an update is needed, do the following:

* git clone https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui
* cp -r swagger-ui/dist/\* embedded/assets/swagger-ui
* change in embedded/assets/swagger-ui/index.html:

Packaging the Code
------------------

Once the code is built, the code can be package for storage in Github or for use by the **install.sh** script.

Running the **tools/package.sh** script will generate a **dr-provision.zip** and **dr-provision.sha256** file.  These files
can be used with the :ref:`rs_install` process.
