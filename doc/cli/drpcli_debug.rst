drpcli debug
------------

Gather [type] of debug information and save it to [target]

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~

This command gathers various different types of runtime profile data
from a running dr-provision server, provided it has the /api/v3/debug or
/api/v3/drp_debug. The types of data that can be gathered are:

::

   profile: CPU utilization profile information.  Tracks how much CPU time is being used in which
            functions, based on sampling which functions are running every 10 ms.  If the
            --seconds flag is unspecified, profile will gather 30 seconds worth of data.

   trace: Execution trace information, including information on where execution is blocked on
          various types of IO and synchronization primitives.  If the --seconds flag is unspecified,
          trace will gather 1 second of data.

   heap: Memory tracing information for all live data in memory. heap is always point-in-time data.

   heapdump: All live objects in the system.  Use only as directed by support.

   allocs: Memory tracing of all memory that has been allocated since the start of the program
           This includes memory that has been garbage-collected.  alloc is always point-in-time data.

   block: Stack traces of all goroutines that have blocked on synchronization primitives.
          block is always point-in-time data.

   mutex: Stack traces of all holders of contended mutexes.  mutex is always point-in-time data.

   threadcreate: Stack traces of all goroutines that led to the creation of a new OS thread.
                 threadcreate is always point-in-time data.

   goroutine: Stack traces of all current goroutines. goroutine is always point-in-time data.

   index: Returns the indexes of the stacks with the flags of the object.
