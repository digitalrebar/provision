Digital Rebar version 4.2 [Winter 2019]
---------------------------------------

Release Date: December 31, 2019

Release Themes: Elevated Permissions and Access from Endpoint

Digital Rebar v4.2 significantly expanded the ability to operate in diverse operational environments with the introduction of Contexts and other Endpoint improvements.  Taken together, they expand and streamline the ability for workflows to securely modify and interact with a broad range of support systems.

Along with improvements to the core platform, RackN included numerous usability, bug fixes, and content extensions.  Some of the notable ones include enhanced elevated permissions for tasks, filtering enhancements that were tied into the UX and integrating commonly used tools into Digital Rebar components.

Note: since the v4.3 release included major architectural work and required more development time; consequently, v4.2 needed more patches than most RackN release cycles.

See :ref:`rs_release_summaries` for a complete list of all releases.

Important Notices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerabilities
+++++++++++++++

The following vulnerabilities were reported and fixed this release.  See the CVE for which releases contain the fix.

* :ref:`rs_cve_20200924a`


Critical Known Issues
+++++++++++++++++++++

* The DRP binary includes a time-limited embedded license that will disable operations if not replaced by a RackN issued license.  In a new installation after the time-limit, DRP API v4.5 and earlier will not allow users to upload their license during installation before stopping.  To workaround this problem, create the full install path (e.g. ``/var/lib/dr-provision/saas-content/``), copy the license file there _before_ installing.,
